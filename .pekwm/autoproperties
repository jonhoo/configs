/*
 Autoproperties. The default template and simple course of autopropping
 to help you add your own autoproperties. See the documentation for
 more keywords and the rest of what is possible through this file.

 First, it's good to note that you can't just make up the property
 string, you need to use a program called 'xprop' to show it. Please
 conduct the documentation.

 Another good tip is to make sure you have an ApplyOn entry. The
 autoproperties you define won't do any good if you don't tell pekwm
 when to apply them!

 Third tip. You can't match a window with more than one property. The
 first one that matches will be used, the rest ignored (see the gimp
 example).

 Note that the default entries are commented out, don't comment out your
 own autoproperties. :)

 Next, we do some siple window title rewriting.
 To make it simple, you can automatically make some windows get their
 title edited. Cut out an annoying piece, add text, replace text.
 This all happens in it's own section "TitleRules {}".

 I don't like the way dillo uses its titlebar, it says "Dillo: webpage".
 I want that "Dillo:" part to not show in the beginning, instead I want
 to make it show as "webpage - dillo".

 Then again, the "webpage - Mozilla Firefox" is too long for my taste.
 I shorten it in the second titlerule. And I'll place the shortened text
 in the beginning of the title just as a show how.
